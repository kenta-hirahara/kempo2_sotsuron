# KEMPO2: Space Plasma Simulator

*KEMPO2 (Kyoto university ElectroMagnetic Particle cOde in 2D)* is a two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell code with Graphical User Interface for the analysis of whistler-mode instability. The simulation interface is designed with App Designer in MATLAB environment. This simulator was developed by Kenta Hirahra, as the final project of the Bachelor's studie.

# Requirements

MATLAB 2019a or higher.

# Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kenta-hirahara/kempo2_sotsuron.git

```

# Code execution

Run 'KEMPO2' in the command window. Then the UI shows up and you can set parameters as you wish.

# Note

For meaningful results the grid size have to be at least 64 squared for xy place, as well as particle number 128 since the Gaussian distribution is applied to the particles.
